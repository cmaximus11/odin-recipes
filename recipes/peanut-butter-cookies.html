    <p>These 3-ingredient peanut butter cookies are one of my favorite cookies to make. They are the only peanut butter cookies my family will eat! Sprinkle a pinch of sugar on cookies before baking, if desired.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Peanut butter and sugar: You will need equal parts peanut butter and white sugar for the dough (one cup each).</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg lends moisture and helps hold the cookie dough together.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>2. Mix peanut butter, sugar, and egg together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>3. Roll mixture into 1-inch balls and place 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
        <li>4. Flatten each with a fork, making a criss-cross pattern. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are firm, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>5. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
