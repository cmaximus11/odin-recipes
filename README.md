# odin-recipes

This is my first project within the Odin Project.

In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time I’ve finished but it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops; I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

Skills I have learned so far include:

Github
Git
Terminal commands
HTML

Lets keep rocking!
